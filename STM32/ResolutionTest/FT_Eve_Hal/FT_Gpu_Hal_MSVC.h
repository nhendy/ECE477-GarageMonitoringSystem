* File Description:
*    This file defines the generic APIs of host access layer for the FT800 or EVE compatible silicon.
*    Application shall access FT800 or EVE resources over these APIs,regardless of I2C or SPI protocol.
*    I2C and SPI is selected by compiler switch "FT_I2C_MODE"  and "FT_SPI_MODE". In addition, there are
*    some helper functions defined for FT800 coprocessor engine as well as host commands.
